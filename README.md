# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using customer demographic information and banking behavior. The goal is to predict which customers are likely to leave the bank, allowing the business to take measures to retain these customers.
# Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses, including banks. This project uses a Random Forest classifier to predict churn based on historical customer data. The dataset includes both demographic details (such as age, gender, etc.) and banking behavior (such as account balance, transactions, etc.).

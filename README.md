# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using customer demographic information and banking behavior. The goal is to predict which customers are likely to leave the bank, allowing the business to take measures to retain these customers.
# Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses, including banks. This project uses a Random Forest classifier to predict churn based on historical customer data. The dataset includes both demographic details (such as age, gender, etc.) and banking behavior (such as account balance, transactions, etc.).
# Data
The dataset consists of various features related to the bank customers, such as:

-Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
-Age: The age of the customer.
Gender: Male/Female.
Account Balance: The current balance in the customerâ€™s account.
Credit Score: Customer's credit score.
Number of Products: Number of products/services the customer is using.
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member.
Estimated Salary: The estimated yearly salary of the customer.
Churn: A binary label (1 = churn, 0 = no churn), indicating whether the customer left the bank.
